Problem Statement:
Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments
Data Description:
- Tweet ID: A unique identifier for each comment tweet.
- Borderlands: The entity of interest associated with the comment (e.g., video ID, creator name).
- Sentiment: The sentiment label assigned to the comment regarding the specified entity. Three classes
are present: Positive, Negative, Neutral. Messages irrelevant to the entity are categorized as Neutral.
- Tweet Content: The textual content of the comment tweet.
Background:
YouTube serves as a prominent platform for content consumption and interaction, fostering a rich
ecosystem of discussions through comments. Understanding the sentiment of comments towards specific
entities, such as video content or creators, is crucial for gauging audience reception and shaping content
strategies effectively. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project aims to analyze
YouTube comments to discern sentiment towards targeted entities.

Objective:
The objective of this internship project is to perform entity-level sentiment analysis on YouTube
comments using provided training and validation datasets. Given a comment and a specified entity (e.g.,
video ID or creator name), the task is to classify the sentiment of the comment as Positive, Negative, or
Neutral, with messages irrelevant to the entity also categorized as Neutral.
